# Library Management System Project

## Vision Statement
The Library Management System will help the library organize books and members, make borrowing and returning items easier, and keep track of everything simply. It will make work faster for staff and make it easier for clients to use the library.

## Scope Statement
The project will include:
- Keeping track of books, digital media, and magazines
- Managing member accounts
- Borrowing, returning, and reserving items
- Setting rules for borrowing and late fees
- Reminding people about due dates and reservations
- Making reports about borrowing, fines, and library use
- Two simple interfaces: one for staff, one for clients

The project will not include connecting to other library systems or making a mobile app.
